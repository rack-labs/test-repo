## Path Rule

- Use repository-relative paths in workflow docs, templates, and management documents.
- Do not write absolute local filesystem paths such as `C:/...` into reusable workflow rules.

## Matrix Sync Rule Template

Use this rule block at the top of a parent management document that has child plan documents, and at the top of each child plan document.

```md
## Matrix Sync Rule
- 부모 문서의 matrix는 하위 plan 문서들의 상태, 결정, 연동 위험을 요약한다.
- 하위 plan 문서의 상세 구현 항목이 외부 계약을 바꾸면 부모 matrix의 해당 row를 갱신한다.
- 부모 matrix에서 scope, priority, dependency, 상태가 바뀌면 관련 하위 plan 문서의 matrix도 갱신한다.
- 하위 plan 문서의 상태가 `결정 필요`, `구현 완료`, `검증 완료`, `보류`, `차단됨`으로 바뀌면 부모 row 상태와 `갱신 필요 사항`도 함께 재검토한다.
- 부모 matrix는 세부 구현의 source of truth가 아니라 통합 tracking index다. 세부 구현 source of truth는 하위 plan 문서다.
```

## Plan Integration Matrix Template

Use this matrix in a parent management document to track child plan documents as feature or architecture units. Do not duplicate child implementation details here.

```md
## Plan Integration Matrix

| ID | 구분 | 하위 문서 | 상태 | 결정된 방향 | 연동 대상 | 갱신 필요 사항 | 다음 액션 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PLAN-01 | Feature or architecture unit | `child-plan.md` | 구현 필요 | Parent-level direction. | Related plans or systems | What must be synced when this row changes. | Next parent-level action |
```

## Implementation Status & Decision Matrix Template

Use this matrix in planning documents when a task needs explicit tracking of implementation layers, decisions, open questions, and next actions.

Status values:
- `결정 완료`: Direction is decided and no further judgment is needed.
- `결정 필요`: A direction must be chosen before implementation can proceed.
- `구현 필요`: Direction is clear enough and implementation remains.
- `구현 중`: Work is actively in progress and does not yet meet done criteria.
- `구현 완료`: Implementation is done, but verification may still remain.
- `검증 필요`: The result needs tests, runtime checks, data comparison, or review.
- `검증 완료`: The defined verification criteria passed.
- `보류`: Intentionally deferred from the current scope.
- `차단됨`: Progress is blocked by an external dependency, missing decision, data, permission, or environment issue.

Matrix rules:
- Use exactly one status value per row.
- If direction is decided but work remains, use `구현 필요` and record the decision in `결정된 방향`.
- Use `없음` in `결정 필요 사항` when no open decision remains.
- Keep `다음 액션` to one immediately executable step.
- Use repository-relative paths or section names in `참조`.

```md
## Implementation Status & Decision Matrix

| ID | 구분 | 레이어/단계 | 상태 | 결정된 방향 | 결정 필요 사항 | 다음 액션 | 참조 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ITEM-01 | Short item name | Contract / Service / UI / Test / Future scope | 구현 필요 | Decided implementation direction. | 없음 | Next concrete action. | Related section or `path/to/file.py` |
| ITEM-02 | Deferred item | Future scope | 보류 | Why it is deferred. | 없음 | Create a follow-up issue when needed. | Related issue or planning note |
```

## Pre-Execution Gate Template

```text
Before any file edit, creation, move, or deletion, re-check whether the task belongs to tracked issue work.
If it does, open the matching management document first.
"Small task", "simple fix", "one-line change", and "quick cleanup" are not exceptions.
Only pure question-answer turns with no file changes are exempt.
If unsure, read `docs/agent-workflow/documentation-rules.md` again before changing files.
```

## Recent Active Context Template

```text
## Recent Active Context

- Last active work: `26-chore-clean-up-repository-before-mvp-v2`
- Tracking doc: `docs/mvp-v2/issues/sub-issues/26-chore-clean-up-repository-before-mvp-v2.md`
- Summary: repository cleanup triage was in progress; keep, remove, move, and archive decisions were being aligned with mvp-v2 management docs and workflow rules.
- Use rule: treat this section as a resume hint only when the user's new work clearly matches the same issue or sub-issue. For simple questions, respond directly without switching work context.
```

## Issue Management Document Template

```text
